A/C#  D
Your face
 A/C#        D         
Lights up the sky on the 
 A/C#  D  A/C#-D
highway
A/C#  D
Someday
A/C#             D		
You'll share your world 
  A/C# D
with me someday

C#m7         D
You mesmerize me
C#m7      D
With diamond eyes
C#m7        D 		
I try to fool myself 
 C#m7         D
to think I'll be alright
C#m7         D     
But I am losin' all 
      C#m7-D
control
  C#m7          D  
My mind, my heart, 
           C#m7  D
my body and my soul

CHORUS
A             Em
Never in my life 
               Bm
have I been more sure
Dm              
So come up to me 
                 A
and close the door
Em               
Nobody's made me 
               Bm
feel this way before
	  Dm (pause)   
You're everything I 
            
wanted and more

INTERLUDE

C#m7             D
To speak or not to 
C#m7      D
Where to begin
C#m7          D       
The great dilemmas I'm 
C#m7            D
finding myself in
C#m7               
For all I know you 
D                 C#m7-D
only see me as a friend
C#m7              D
I try to tell myself, wake up fool
	 C#m7         
This fairy tale's 
  D
got to end
