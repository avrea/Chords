<PRE>INTRO
B-F#-A-E 2x

		 B          
When the stars fade 
 F#
their light
		  A           
Does the moon and sun 
E
make it right
	B             
For you, the world 
F#
maybe
		  A         E            
Like an endless storm chasing a mystery

INTERLUDE
B-F#-A-E/G#

		  B           F#
If there is hate in your heart
		  A             
Does your body drop and 
 E            E BREAK*
tell you to stop
	  B         F#
Loving you, loving me
		A             
When it all falls down 
         E/G#        BREAK*
you just sing with me

CHORUS
				   
('Cause there's a) 
B                  F#
blue sky waiting tomorrow
		   A             
Waiting tomorrow, shining 
      E/G#
and shimmering
  B                 
A blue sky waiting 
F#
tomorrow
		  A             
Waiting tomorrow, maybe 
  E/G#
it's all we need

  B      
Oh, don't you wash away that smile
		 F#
You just look out the window and see the light
  A
It's beautiful to be alive
	  E/G#
It's wonderful to live a life
B
The sun is sure to shine
   F#
For you and me, for everyone
  A
So don't be sad, it's just the start
	E/G#
Of a new beginning in your life

REPEAT Chorus

E           F#
Rain will keep 
         B
on pouring
E               
Some things you 
F#        B 
can't control
E             
And while the 
 F#        B
sun seems far
F#  E/G# F#  E PAUSE*
And hard to hold
		   B-F#
It will unfold
			 A        
There will always be a blue sky
  E/G#                     
A blue sky waiting tomorrow
		 B    F#   
Full of hope, yeah, 
         A    E/G#
full of hope, yeah
