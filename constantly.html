<PRE>INTRO
CM7-Bm7-BbM7-Am7-G

G      
I know it was there
			 CM7
Though I tried to hide it
				
But the feeling 
  FM7
just kept
			 G
On shining through
G
Haven't known you that long
		  CM7
So I try to deny it
				
But the feeling 
 FM7
was much
			   Em
Too much too strong

Em            EbM7
Could this be love
	   Am7
Deep down inside
		Bm7
Tearing me apart
   C           D7sus
I feel it in my heart

CHORUS
	CM7               
Constantly, you're on 
Bm7
my mind
		  BbM7         
Thinking about you all 
   Am7
the time
	 CM7                
I can't sleep no matter 
    Bm7
what I do
	  BbM7              
I just keep on thinking 
    Am7
'bout you

G
Why do I feel this way
				
When I know you 
  CM7
have someone
				 FM7
That you're seeing 
             G
each and every day
	 G
Should I play this game
			
Of just being 
	 CM7
your friend
			
When I know 
	   FM7
that's not
				  Em
Where I want it to end

Em              
How could this 
EbM7
be wrong
  Am7
When the feeling's so strong
	   Bm7
Tearing me apart
  C             
I feel it in my 
D7sus
heart

REPEAT CHORUS 2X

  EbM7
No, I don't want to start 
G
no trouble
   Cm          F  
Between you and I 
         G
and your lover
   EbM7
But I must tell you
	 G
What I'm going through
	   Am7       Bm7
Everytime you walk by
	 C        
I see love in 
    D7sus  CM7
your eyes

Bm7              BbM7
You're on my mind
Am7
Keep on thinking about your love
CM7            Bm7
I can't sleep
	  BbM7      
I just keep on 
            Am7
thinking about you
