<PRE>INTRO
A-E-F#m-D-; (2x)

A                    
Swaying room as the 
E
music starts
F#m         
Strangers making the 
 D
most of the dark
A                  
Two by two their 
 E            F#m-D
bodies become one

A                      
I see you through the 
E
smoky air
F#m     
Can't you feel the 
   D
weight of my stare
A                      
You're so close but 
	E      C#7   F#m
still a world away
		
And what I'm 
D
dying to say, is that

CHORUS
	A
I'm crazy for you
E         
Touch me once and you'll 
  F#m
know it's true
D                 A
I never wanted anyone 

like this
	E
It's all brand new
	 F#m                 
You'll feel it 

in my kiss
D break          
I'm crazy for 
A-E-F#m-D
you

A                  E
Trying hard to control 

my heart
F#m                D
I walk over to where 

you are
A                E  
Two by two we need 
			 F#m-D
no words at all

A                    E
Slowly now as we begin 

to move
F#m  
With every breath 
			 D
I'm deeper into you
A                  E      
Soon we two are standing 
 C#7      F#m
still in time
		   D
But if you read my 

mind, you'll see
