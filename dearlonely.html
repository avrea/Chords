<PRE>INTRO: G

G
Dear lonely, you hurt me
Am                             
You just came and knocked 
	Cm
me down
       D
That's right
G
Dear lonely, you tore me
Am                       Cm
Say hello, it's been a while
        D                          
And now you're here to stay 
	  G
once again, oh woh
              

G                        
And I can't make you go away
Bm
So I'll just beg you 

please don't stay
Em                                
Now filled with tears it's all 
	Cm
because you're here
Em
And there you go again, 

and there you go again
Cm
There you go again
D         G
Dear lonely


         G
I say, dear lonely, 

now are you happy?
Am                       
Keep on messing with 
	Cm
my life
         D
That's right
G
What's the deal lonely, 

come face me
Am
Why'd you have to 
		Cm
come at night?
    D                    
You know it's not 

right, oh woh


G                        
And I can't make you go away
Bm    
So I'll just beg you 

please don't stay
Em       
Now filled with tears it's all 
	Cm
because you're here
Em
And there you go again, 

and there you go again
Cm
There you go again
D         G
Dear lonely


Am                        Cm
You're in my bed when I sleep
           D               
And in my pillow you 
		G
bring tears, oh woh
Am                   
I can't wait for the 
F
day that you will leave
Am                     
If I could only find a 
F
way to live in peace
D       
You wouldn't have 

to take control over me



G
Oh, every tears, tears, 

lonely, lonely
G
Yes, I'm talkin' to you
