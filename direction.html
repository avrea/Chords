<PRE>Cm
I need your own advice
Cm
I'm falling far behind
Cm
You need to tell me now
       G#          Bb 
If im pushing you away 

Cm
I suffer with your dust
Cm
Im burnin all your trust
Cm 
I can't believe it's true
        G#       Bb  
That I need you here 
    Cm
to stay 

G#              Cm
I need your attention
                   G# 
Point me to the right 
   Cm 
direction
G#              Cm 
I've made my decision
Cm 
Point me to the right direction 


Cm
I'm looking in your eyes
Cm 
I'm reading all your lies
Cm
I pretend to be alright
G#               Bb 
But it kills me down inside 

Bb
I need to move away
Bb 
From the broken endless day 
Bb
When time is runnin out
       G#       Bb     Cm 
Can you help me once again
 
Cm
So here I am
Cm 
To my last stand
Cm 
I'm tired to fall
Cm 
I'm tired to crawl 
Cm
It's my goodbye 
To one and all
Cm 
Just like before
Cm 
Away from you
</PRE></div></div></div></div>
