<PRE>INTRO
G C9 G C9 (3x)

     G     C9
Let the sunshine
        F      C 
Let the rivers run away
                   G         
Coz it's a beautiful 
		C9
day now to play now
F                     D
And as I close my eyes 

and pray 

     G         C9 
Lord have mercy on me 
F                      
Coz I'm feeling kind a 
C
lonely 
Em         D               
Could you be would you be 
Bb
my one and only


G                   
Took a train at the 
C9
station 
F                  
And almost lost my 
C
patience coz' I was waiting
G           C9
Damned rain delayed 

the train 

F                            
I’m waiting in a vain just 
D
to see your face  
G                    
Is this the one that 
C9
I’m supposed to be afraid of
F                    
Is this the one that 
C
I’m supposed to be ashamed of
Em              
Hard as a rock 
D
not soft like play do 
Bb                                                  
Every time I hear the 
F
song playing on the radio  


REPEAT INTRO


        G    C9
Let the wind blow
        F             C 
Let the wind touch my face 
               G         C9
I wanna take a lil' break 

now to shake now 

   F           D         
And this is what 

I have to say 
  G      C
I feel so fine
F          C
So fine that it 

blows my mind
Em               D      
To tell the truth 
	 Bb
when will you be mine    



Em                           
And in my dreams you 

are real so it seems
Bb
Inside my head a giant s

creen plays every scene
F
While I sleep I feel you 

every time I go to sleep
C
Wake up in the middle 

of the night and I weep  
G                                
It’s gotta be mine that 
F
girl is so fine
Em           D
Girl be mine, 

girl be mine

Bb                      
All it takes is a matter 
F
of time


INSTRUMENTAL
G C9 D C9


Em                           
And in my dreams you are so
Bb
real, oh so it seems
F                           C
Inside my head a giant screen, 

plays every scene
G                     F                     
So you see I feel you every 
				D
time I go to sleep

C       
All it takes is a 

matter of time 
C               
Tell the truth
