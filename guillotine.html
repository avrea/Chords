<PRE>INTRO
B--E--G#m

G#m
What's done is done
And we've crossed the line			
Your indecision is taking 
			E
over every time
Your pride, my anger
F#
Our situation is worse than ever

G#m
We've taken this too far
			  E
We've had our run
With your arms wrapped tight
		  F#
Around my neck			
Close my eyes I sink and 
			 E
grasp for breath
She's with someone new

CHORUS
G#m            B
All hope is gone
				
And since you're 
			  E
never gonna change
					
I'll erase your taste 
			G#m
and let you go slowly
   B                E
Suddenly I wasn't enough
					
Your lust disguised 
	  G#m
as love

G#m
You're pushing me too far
			  E
We've had our run
With your arms wrapped tight
		  F#
Around my neck
Close my eyes, I sink and 
		 E
grasp for breath

REPEAT CHORUS

ADLIB
G#m-B-E 2x

E                   F#
She's with someone new
					G#m
(She's with someone new)
				  F#
She's with someone new
				   G#m
(She's with someone new)

G#m                  F#
This whole time with me

Was just another lie
  G#m
Threw my feelings up and down
		B
You're just a little inconsiderate
G#m                  F#
This whole time with me

Was just another lie
	G#m             B      
Was just another lie

G#m
What's done is done

And we've crossed the line
					
Your indecision is 
			    	 E
taking over every time

Your pride, my anger
F#                     
Our situation is worse 
           E-F#
than ever

REPEAT CHORUS

E             F#
All hope is gone, 
all hope is
G#m            B
All hope is gone, 
all hope is
E             F#
All hope is gone, 
all hope is
G#m            B
All hope is gone, 
all hope is
