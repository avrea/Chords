C-G/B-Am-F PAUSE*

C   G/B     Am      G
So long to you my love
	 F     C      Dm    G
Don't be afraid to run away
C   G/B       Am    G
I know you'll be okay
	 F         C        Dm-G
Just take your time to find

CHORUS
			   C   
(But/Cause) I need 
          G/B
you here tonight
  Am              F

Tonight   (oh)

C     G/B   Am      Em
Made up my mind on this
	F       C      
Too late for me to 
Dm       G
hold you back
C   G/B     Am       Em 
Maybe too short or dumb
   F       C         
To cry for you but I 
Dm      G
will anyway

REPEAT CHORUS

C     G/B    Am
It's all my fault
   Em        F       
To feel this way for 
C        Dm-G
you that day
C   G/B   Am        Em
I know I am and I will
			F         
Though it's wrong, so 
 C         Dm-G
wrong, so wrong

REPEAT CHORUS
EXCEPT LAST LINE

   C          G/B
I need you, I need you
 Dm               F
I need you here inside
   C          G/B
I need you, I need you
 Dm               
I really, really 
        F HOLD*
need you here
