<PRE>INTRO
Em-F#m-G-; (2x)

Bm     A         
Hey baby, how's 
 G        Em
life been movin' on?
Bm       A       G
I can't deny it, now 

you're gone
Bm              A
This is the first time
	G
Can I make it through?
Em                 
Without you now, do 
F#m7          G        A
the things I used to do

Bm          A          
It's getting harder to 
   G        Em
ease the pain
Bm             A
The feeling changes, 
G
love still remains
Bm             A     
I don't know how if I can 
G
get this right
Em7           
Maybe given time
	  F#m7            
I'll make the most of 
G        A
what I've got

REFRAIN
G                               
Is this the (price/love) 
		F#m
we (pay/have)
							
With all the good 
			Em7
times we shared?
Em           
Faithfully, we've 
D
got a reason to go on
G                    
I know it's good 
      F#m
to be true
			
Just spend the 
			Em
nights with you
						 
Let me tell you that our 
A
love can make it through

CHORUS
D              Bm7
Hold on, baby hold on
   G         F#m             
We've got to go on now, this 
Em7         A
feeling so strong
D            Bm7
Hold on, baby hold on
	   Em            
It's a burning desire comin' 
G
right down the wire

Bm        A          
Sweet talking, it's 
G           Em
all in the line
		   Bm      A
There's no turning back
		  G       
Unless you make up 
     G/B
your mind
Bm          A    
The expectations after 
 G
all these years
Em7            F#m7         
Risin' to the moment, let's 
 G               A
forget all our fears

REPEAT REFRAIN

BRIDGE
G                      A
And when the night is over
				 G        
Well, no one can deny it, 
 F#m    Em    A
got to believe in
	  G             A
We couldn't ask for more 

Than to hold each other tight
G                 Em           
It's just we'll never take 
       F#m      G  A
things for granted
