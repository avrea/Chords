C               F
First time I laid

my eyes on someone like you 
C           F
I can't forget the hour
	G
That moment with you 
Em           F
Then I have realized
G               
Love is growing 
C
deep inside 
Am         
I feel the 
 Dm             G
beating of my heart 

CHORUS
			C    
'Cause every day, 
        Em
every night
	   F          
I keep looking at 
     G
the skies 
		  C       
And I'll pray that 
    Em
someday 
		F              G
You will wake up in my arms 
			  
And love will 
Am       Am/G
never end

We belong together, 
F              Em
always and forever

I'll be there

How you make me 
 F
wanna smile 
	   G
With the things that you do

When will I 
 F
hear you say
