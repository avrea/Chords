<PRE>INTRO
Em HOLD*
G-Am7-Bm7-Am7,D7-G--; (2x)

G                
So many faces, 
Am7
so many races
Bm7               
Different voices, 
Am7            D7
different choices
G                    
Some are mad, 
	  Am7
while others laugh
Bm7                
Some live alone 
    Am7            D7
with no better half
G                  
Others grieve 
     Am7
while others curse
Bm7                          
And others mourn behind 
	 Am7       D7
a big black hearse
G                     
And some are pure 
   Am7
and some half-bred
Bm7                
Some are sober and 
Am7           D7
some are wasted
G                 
Some are rich 
   Am7
because of fate
Bm7                     
And some are poor with 
Am7               D7
no food on their plate
G                   
Some stand out while 
Am7
others blend
Bm7                            
And some are fat and stout, & 
 Am7         D7
some are thin
G                          
And some are friends, and 
Am7
some are foes
Bm7                     
Some have some, while 
Am7       D7 
some have most
G-Am7-Bm7-Am7-D7-
Yeah heh...

REFRAIN
				G          
(Cause) Every color, 
	  D
every hue
   Bm            
Is represented by 
C
me and you
	   G            D
Take a slide in the slope
  Bm                
Take a look in the 
C
kaleidoscope
		 G                  
Spin it 'round (and) 
       D
make a twirl
C                       
In this kaleidoscope 
G-Am7-Bm7-Am7-D7-G-Am7-Bm7-Am7-D7
world    yeah

G                
Some are great and 
Am7
some are few
Bm7               
Others lie while 
Am7            D7
some tell the truth
G                     
And some say poems and 
Am7
some do sing
Bm7               Am7            
And others sing through 
		  D7
the guitar strings
G                   Am7
Some know it all, while 

some act dumb
Bm7                       
Let the baseline strum to 
Am7            D7
the bang of the drum
G                  
Some can swim, but 
Am7
some will sink
Bm7                  
And some will find 
Am7            D7
their minds and think
G                Am7
Others walk, while 

others run
Bm7               Am7            
You can't talk peace 
			D7
and have a gun
G                Am7
Some are hurt and start 

to cry
Bm7               Am7            
Don't ask me how, don't 
		D7
ask me shy
G                          
And some are friends, 
	Am7
and some are foes
Bm7                     
Some have some, while
Am7       D7 
some have most

G-Am7-Bm7-Am7-D7-
Yeah heh...
