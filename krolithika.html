VERSE I

Em
creeping like a spider
           C               
ignore the marks that evil 
    Am       C
has left behind
Em
 they starve, you bloat
C             
 they die and 
 Am        C 
 still you bloat
    Em
and yet, the people wait
    C
the people are waiting
Am        C        
watch the water and 
 Em
let it guide you
C                   
watch the water and 
Am     C
let it kill you

REFRAIN
Em                    
Die follow the water!
C              Am-C
Die follow the water!
Em                    
Die follow the water!
C              Am-C
Die follow the water!

VERSE II
<I>Follow verse I chords</I>
Choking like your fucker
they choke on bones that you have left behind
they starve, you bloat
they lifted you up
how can they wait?
you've eaten the children
watch the water and let it guide you
watch the water and let it kill you

REPEAT REFRAIN

Em                
heads are rolling 
C                Em 
down your golden stairs
             
and you come 
C          Am     C
closer and still you
Em   C    Am
DIE! DIE! DIE!
Em   C    Am
DIE! DIE! DIE!

Em                
heads are rolling 
C                Em
down your golden stairs
                   
tell me, does your 
C                  
bitch need another 
Am           C
ring or they die?
Em                
heads are rolling 
C                Em

Am           C
