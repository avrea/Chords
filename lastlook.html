<PRE>INTRO
A

A
Can I be a little selfish?
F#m
And I swear I'll come 
back home to you
A
Our head's turned the last kiss
F#m               
Make me yours and 
                     E 
kill me with your stare

REFRAIN
E
Leaves shaking, 
F#m
let's follow
E
I'm staying 
F#m
with you angel
E
Till the fear dies, 
F#m           E    
I won't let go

I won't let go

CHORUS
A            
So far away, 
          F#m
one last look
		 E          
It's the same thing 
     A
as before
A              
Am I too late, 
           F#m (E)
one last look

A
How could you just take me?
F#m
A silent frame, 
a heart I fell into
A
Let's pray for the violence
F#m
3:47, it's just 
another requiem

REPEAT REFRAIN
REPEAT CHORUS

		E
Till we sleep forever

REPEAT CHORUS

		 E
Till we sleep forever 
  E7
(sleep forever)

D           E    
A love in wait, 
              A   F#m
I'll watch you go
D           E     
We lie in state, 
             A   F#m
I'll watch you go
D           E  
A love in wait 
			 A   F#m
I'll watch you go   4x
