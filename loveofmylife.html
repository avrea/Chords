<PRE>VERSE
F                  Am
Oh, love of my life 
                Bb
Destined forever 
              Bbm     
I will be right here 
            F
By your side 
               Am
No falling tears 
                  Bb
When we're together
                Bbm 
You know the joy 
You bring to me 

REFRAIN

Am               
Never, there'll 
        Dm
be no other 
                    Gm
We'll share as lovers 
                    Cm
Right from the heart 
From my mind to your soul 
               Am
I will give it to you girl 
      DM
My every little thing 
          Gm
That I'm more than willing 
Cm
I will give to you 

CHORUS
<I>Follow refrain chords</I>

Forever starts from now 
I promise you 
Lovin' you is all 
That I can do 
No one can take it 
Away from me 
Nobody but you 

<I>Follow verse chords</I>
Now is the time 
stars will be bright 
Our bodies will groove 
All through the night 
Come take my hand 
Then we will fly high 
Come on baby hear me say 

REPEAT REFRAIN
REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE

There'll be no time 
For sad goodbyes 
Without you here 
I can't get by 
Don't you go away 
</PRE></div></div></div></div>
