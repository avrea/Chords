   Intro: B-Ebm-E-F#-; (2x)

  B            F#       E                 F#
   Out of my mind, but still I see you here
  B          F#          E              F#
   Out of my time, but still I'm waiting here
        G#m                  Ebm
   I know there’s no way but I know someday
  C#m                        F#
   You will end up in this heart of mine

               Chorus
  B          Ebm          E  F#
   You will always be my mine
  B               Ebm                                 
   You will always be
      E               F#
   In my heart and in my mind
  G#m            Ebm
   I will wait forever
     G#m             Ebm
   And I will not say never
  C#m       Ebm      E       F#       B
   Until the day that I can call you mine

   Interlude: B-Ebm-E-F#

  B                  F#
   For once in my life
     E                           F#
   I have found what I’m looking for
  B             F#
   I know I’m right
    E                      F#
   That it’s you I’m asking for
          G#m            Ebm
   Is there any way I can make you stay 
  C#m                            F#
   Another lifetime’s not enough for you

   (Repeat Chorus except last word)

                E-F#-G#m-F#
          ... mine

    E--F#--G#m--F#-
    Ohh hoh...

   (Repeat Chorus except last word)

              B-Ebm-E-
        ... mine

   Can call you mine
