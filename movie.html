<PRE>VERSE I

E
The movie’s done once more
E
The mood sets in with lights
E                        E/Eb
Let’s wait for them to leave
                         E
I was never one for crowds

E                      A
I look down on the floor
E
Everything’s undone
E                         A
Yet we’ve been so much more
                         E
Than a full length feature

Interlude: E E/Eb A C#m-B

G#m             
We long for escape
           A
Let this memory take shape
           E             E/Eb
For the heroes we often see
         G#m
I don’t know if it’s me 
          A
Or the movies we’ve seen
                E
I don’t remember
E/Eb
As well as i should

CHORUS
E          E/Eb             
I stay so silent with your 
A      C#m-B
arms adjacent
       E         
And credits may 
E/Eb      A   C#m-B
soon roll away

INTERLUDE
E A E E/Eb

VERSE II

G#m                  A
You have my jacket on
E             
Comfort in my warmth
                 E/Eb
I’m used to the cold
E/Eb
I’m used to the cold

G#m
And i hope you’d agree
          A
How this story should be
       E                       
How i wish i could 
			E/Eb
change the scenes
           G#m
I’d write on the next page
           A
An early coming of age
            E
For me to tell you
E/Eb
As well as i could

REPEAT CHORUS

       E          E/Eb       
Could I stay so silent with 
 A        C#m-B
your arms adjacent
       E         
The vagueness may 
E/Eb            A   C#m-B
soon come to light


Should
E          E/Eb             
I stay so silent with your 
A      C#m-B
arms adjacent
   E         E/Eb 
As i play my part
        A   C#m-B
in our show

<I>Do chorus chorus</i>

Forever shall i be the 
ill-fated type
Forever must i be the 
one you confide to
Forever must i be 
the pages you need
For you to write 
all the secrets that
You hope i would keep
Forever must i drive 
you home late at night
After watching these 
films that seem 
to imitate life
Forever must i be
the opinion you seek
Forever will i be 
the friend that you would keep
