<PRE>INTRO
G-D/F#-Em - Em-D/F#-G (2x)

VERSE I
     G        
Your smile is 
D/F#     Em
gently freezing
    Em     D/F#     G
The snow throws it away
               G     
You're the laughter 
D/F#   Em
in my silence
    Em         
The cold that 
D/F#     G
keeps me awake
     G         D/F#  Em
Green towel is soft spoken
    Em         D/F#     G
With thoughts you never knew
 G                
Coz the lies and 
D/F#   Em
empty promises
 Em                D/F#
I blew them all in you

REFRAIN
C9             D
How does it feel?
C9		D
How is it that I can't feel?
Bm	  C9	      D Dsus D
Cos I, I need to know

CHORUS
G	Em			
Coz I, I know I 
Bm
can never be enough
        C9
To replace your whatever
G	Em			
And I, I think 
Bm
it's shiny and blue
          C9
Like a dance 

that's see-thru
G	Em			
Coz I, I know I 
Bm
can never be enough
         C9
To replace your whatever
Em 
Now everything is silent

D
And everything is 

still without you near

INTERLUDE
G-D/F#-Em - Em-D/F#-G (2x)

VERSE II
 G      D/F#     Em
Everything about you
Em        D/F#         G
The world was something new
G          D/F#        Em
And I was there in the open
Em         D/F#       G
Well, just to be with you
   G         
But everytime 
 D/F#        Em
I see the shelter
Em           
And everytime 
D/F#        G
I walk away
               G    
You're the laughter
 D/F#   Em
in my silence
    Em            D/F#  
The cold that fuels 

my day

REPEAT REFRAIN
REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
Em          
And everytime 
D              C9
I see you passing by
C9
I'll just stay here 

waiting for you
Em            D                 
And I will talk to myself on a 
C9           C9
lazy Sunday afternoon
     Em
And I'll still sing 

that prayer for you
D  
I'll be a little bit 
			C9
kind enough for me
                           C9
While I try to be so perfect, 

you'll see that

And nothing can compare to 

whatever lies out there
