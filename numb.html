<PRE>INTRO
D; D-E-D-E-D,E;(8x)
D--D/Eb;(4x)

Dm
I try to lose my self today
and if this pain will go away
D
A thousand days I'd try to waste
i feel your side but your'e still ok.

REFRAIN
D
I feel you, You dont' feel me
I see you, You dont' see me


D
Duck!,Duck! as we stand back to back
seeing disappear and my eyes fades to Black
I wanna let it out when im Back on the track
Causing you to move and bringing you heart attack
And I feel the pain like a Needle in my Vain now
Hurt myself cause i think I didn't know how
Cut myself and Watch me bleed, I turn out as
I watch bleed!

CHORUS
A     Bb             D
Dont' take away your eyes
      A                 
Coz i know youre beside me and
Bb                  D
I just can hold and say
A Bb               D
I wish i'm Numb inside
      A
Coz i dont' want this feeling,
Bb                   D
feeling that i can't hide

INTERLUDE
D--D/Eb;(4x)

Dm
I try to crawl inside of you
And hope this day will go away
D
I turn away to watch you drown
I'm still right here
try to here a sound

REFRAIN

D
Duck!,Duck! as we stand back to back
seeing disappear and my eyes fades to Black
I wanna let it out when im Back on the track
Causing you to move and bringing you heart attack
And I feel the pain like a Needle in my Vain now
Hurt myself cause i think I didn't know how
Cut myself and Watch me bleed, I turn out as
I watch bleed!
