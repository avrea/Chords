<PRE>INTRO
C-G-F-Am-G-C 2x

C          G
I see you, beside me
	  F
It's only a dream
Am               
A vision of what 
G
used to be
C              
The laughter, 
G
the sorrow
F
Pictures in time
Am        G
Fading to memories

C           
How could I 
 G          F
ever let you go?
		 Am        
Is it too late to 
 G     C
let you know?

CHORUS
C          G
I try to run from your side
	   F
But each place I hide
Am    G            C
Only reminds me of you
		 G
When I turn out all the lights
F
Even the night
 Am   G             G#-Bb-C
Only reminds me of you

C         G
I needed my freedom
	   F
That’s what I thought
		Am         G
But I was a fool to believe
C             G
My heart lied when you cried
 F
Rivers of tears
	   Am     G
But I was too blind to see

C            G          
Everything we’ve been 
F
through before
		 Am         G
Now it means so much more

REPEAT CHORUS
EXCEPT LAST WORD

G#-Bb
you

	 G#-Bb
Only you
G#                Bb
So come back to me
			   Cm
I'm down on my knees
			   G pause
Boy can’t you see

C             G  
How could I ever 
       F
let you go
		Am      G 
Is it too late to 
         C
let you know
