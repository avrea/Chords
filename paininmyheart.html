<PRE>INTRO
A-D-E-;

A        D        
Here I am alone in 
E             A
this empty room
	F#m             
And let my mind just 
B              Esus,E
fly you to the end
A             D               
Thoughts of you still linger 
E        A
in my memory
D                
Wond'ring why my 
B                Esus-E
life is not that fair
C#              F#m
I could still recall
	C#           F#m
Those memories of you
   B                  
The joy and all your 
E
laughter
   B                      
The love that we've been 
Esus-E
through
	 A            
Oh, I can't believe 
D        Esus-E
you're gone

CHORUS
	   C#m7      F#m7
I don't want to remember
	Bm7              E
The things we used to do
		C#m7         
All the things that 
D          Esus-E
remind me of you
		A        
I don't want to 
G
hear those songs
	 D               Bdim
The songs we used to sing
			  A
'Cause I don't wanna feel
	E            A-D-E-
The pain in my heart

A        D              
Talkin' to myself for 
E              A
reasons I could find
F#m7             
Findin' out why 
B              Esus-E
everything went wrong
A         D
Tears falling down my cheeks
	E                   A
That I've been trying to hold
  D                
It doesn't know if 
B               Esus-E
I could still go on
 C#             F#m7
I wanted you to stay
	C#             F#m7
The tears begin to show
   B                 E
You said you cared for me
   B               Esus
But then you had to go
E    A     D           
And now I know 
		Esus-E  
you're gone

REPEAT REFRAIN

	 A
... heart

ADLIB
C#-F#m7-C#-F#m7-
B-E-B-Esus-E

	  A            
I just can't believe 
D         Esus-E
you're gone
