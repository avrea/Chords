<PRE>INTRO
Dm--Am-Bb;

<I>Do chords pattern</I>
Dm--Am-Bb

I see my fear Everytime I open up my eyes
When you come around I will tried to hynotize
I talk in fear coz you caught me by suprise
I need to scream or I need to realize

PRECHORUS
<I>Do chords pattern</I>
Dm--Am-Bb

I've been so full of you
Need not to take it
Give something else that I can do
How can I disappear
When I can't even see those thing I tried to hear

CHORUS
     Dm        Bb-C    
I'm sick and tired of 
Dm           Bb-C
all these games
Dm            
This game you 
 Bb-C
tried to feed me
        Dm         Bb-C
But it feels the same 

INTERLUDE
Dm---Dm;(4x)

<I>Do chords pattern</I>
Dm--Am-Bb

Now that you're gone maybe I can be like someone else
I talk to proud just to let it my chest
I can't believe I was'nt stuck inside
Been there for so long did'nt notice past this time

REPEAT PRECHORUS
REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
       Dm      
You'll say you 
Bb     F
be alright
Dm                 
But you wont give 
Bb           F
up without a fight
Dm         Bb         F
Thing have been so unreal
Dm                
Give me something 
 Bb              F
else that I can kill
     A               
Just one more thing 
       C
before go
      A             
When you leave Just 
           C
close the door

REPEAT PRECHORUS
REPEAT CHORUS
