<PRE>VERSE
B     E           B
The time has come
	  E         B
We're breaking in
	E              B
The real world waits
   E           B
To shed our skin
		E            B
And our teenage crimes
	   E         B
We'll leave behind
	  E           B
Mistakes we've made
	 E  
We won't go

G#m        F#
Back for tomorrow 
	 E         F#
When we've got today
	 G#m            F#
We're packing up our sorrow
  E         F#
Tomorrow can wait
	 G#m      
Say hurray, hurray! For the 
F#
past we cling to
  E                   F#
Today, today! We've got 

more to sing to
		G#m     
I'm the kid your parents told 
F#
you not to become
	  E                
But life's too short to 
 F#
live it in fear of

CHORUS
B                
If it's for us, 
E
who can be against us?
G#m          F#
We are the hope 

and the future
	E                    
The promised ones with 
F#
everything to prove
	B         
And with this plan 
	E
written in our hands
G#m          F#
We are the hope 

and the future
	 E                 
The promised ones with 
F#
nothing else to lose

This is as good as it gets, 
your time is of the essence
Day by day, but you're 
not getting younger
You're on both sides of your fate
But dear, we'll find an escape
Living fast, 
dying younger- you're not
Not getting younger but it's okay
So hold back your tears darling
All that can wait

BRIDGE
E      G#m    
The promised ones, 
				F#
we don't know what to do
E      G#m
The promised ones, 
				F#
we don't know what to do
E
Set your mind and your 
heart to anything that you do
E      G#m                         
The promised ones, 
				F#
we don't know what to do
E      G#m
The promised ones, 
				F#
we don't know what to do
E
Set your mind and your 
heart to anything that you do

E
Young and we're reckless
			  G#m
Bored and we're selfish
		  F#
Sick and tired of
E               
Young and we're reckless
			  G#m 
Bored and we're selfish
		  F#
Sick and tired of
