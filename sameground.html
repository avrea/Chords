<PRE>INTRO
A-G-A-G

VERSE I
A
My love
			   G
It's been a long 

time since I cried
		   A     
And left you out 
           G
of the blue
A          G
It's hard leaving 

you that way
				  A   G
When I never wanted to
A                  G
Self-denial is a game, 

it's strange
				
I never would 
		   A
have wanted it
				  G
Until there was you

VERSE II
	A
Cause I have learned that 
					
Love is beyond what 
		   G
human can imagine
						
The more it clears, the 
				  A    G
more I have to let you go

CHORUS
A               
But now I don't 
         E
understand 
				
Why I'm feeling 
   F#m 
so bad now 
		  D 
When I know 
           A
it was my idea
						
I could have just denied 
			  E
the truth and lied
				
But why am I the 
   F#m
only one 
	   D PAUSE*   
Standing stranded on 
             A-G-A-G
the same ground

REPEAT VERSE I

VERSE III
<i>Follow verse chords</I>

Cause I have learned that
Love is a word gets thrown a little bit too much        
The best excuse to fill the infinite abyss
I never ever have to fail

REPEAT CHORUS

ADLIB
A-G-A-G 2x

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
	  A
If all else fail
 G                 
Would you be there 
     A    G
to love me
	   A
When all else fail
	  G              A
Would you be brave to 
             G      A HOLD*
see right through me
