	  D
How many times you've hurt me
	  F#m
So many times you've fooled me
			 A
And you'll be doing it again

		 Bm
So many times we've spent in
		 F#m
Too many lives we've been in
			 A
But you're doing it again

REFRAIN
   G                
(To me/With you) the 
           D(/F#)
nights have fallen
	  Em          
The lights are on 
 Bm
and off again
	A                 
Is there a chance that 
 Bm     G
you won't die
		F#
With me tonight?

CHORUS
 D               DM7          
(Like a/You're) shooting star 
   G
to where you are
	Gm           
Are we too late, 
 D
am I too soon?
		 DM7            
You'll make it through, 
       G
you've gone so far
		E      Gm
Will you ever be my star?

			 D
I'm holding on to nothing
		   Bm
No reason worth for living
		 A(/C#)
For I'm calling out to you
				Bm
If it's the only way to keep you
			  F#m
Then I don't want to break you
	   A
I'm losing grip again

REPEAT REFRAIN
REPEAT CHORUS
REPEAT CHORUS 1 STEP HIGHER

CODA
C#m       B(/D#)
You're walking away
		  A        
I'll be seeing you 
F#m
through a satellite
 C#m          F#m
And if I let you go
		  E
Then I'm walking away
