CM7-C9-C7-FM7-Em7-Dm7-G
CM7-C9-C7-FM7-Em7-Dm7-G

CM7               Am7
I've been with you boy
Em7                      FM7
Three years is quite a while
Am7
But getting too sensual
Em7                FM7
Is really not my style
Am7
You know I love you
	Em7                FM7
And I like it just like this
Am7
And sometimes I feel like
			Em7  
Getting you more than 
		Gsus
just a kiss

REFRAIN
				FM7
But baby it's wrong
		Em7
Baby, it's not my 

kind of game
Am7
If I give it to you now
  Gm7                      
Our love will never be 
	 C7
the same
		  FM7
It won't be long
		 E7sus
We gotta play our 

love just right
			   
I know you know, 
Dm7
time will come
  Gsus        break
But baby for tonight

CHORUS
			CM7       
Let's take it 
			C9
slow (so slow)
  C7
Anywhere you wanna go
	   FM7              
Baby for you, I'll lay 
Em7          Dm7-G
it all on the line
			CM7     C9
You ought to know (I know)
			C7
Boy, ain't got 

nowhere to go
			 FM7   
I'll give it to you, 
		 Em7
only to you
		Dm7            
We gotta take it 
	  Gsus
real slow

Am7
When we get together
	Em7              
You know I feel the 
FM7
fire
Am7         
It burns up inside 

me, oh
   Em7          
That natural 
FM7
desire
Am7
I know that you 

feel it too
  Em7             FM7
I know you wanna flow
Am7
Keep dreamin' about it
	  Em7               
And the fire 
			Gsus
starts to grow

REPEAT REFRAIN
REPEAT CHORUS

Dm7
I know tomorrow
		Em7
It will still be 

you and me
Dm7                        
I'm savin' it all for you 
Em7    A7
especially
Dm7
Trust in me baby
	  Em7  
When I say this to you
	 Dm7               
If we wait a little 
Em7
longer
			F            
Our love will be 
		Gsus break
forever true
