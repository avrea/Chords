<PRE>INTRO
E-A 4x

E 
I believe 
	  A               
We shouldn't let the 
             E
moment pass us by 
E
Life's too short 
	 A                 
We shouldn't wait for 
               E
the water to run dry 

B
Think about it 
  C#m               
'Cause we only have 
              D
one shot at destiny 
D
All I'm asking 
		  E       
Could it possibly 
          A
be you and me? 

CHORUS
A             C#m     
So if you'd still go, 
          D
I'll understand 
	   Bm
Would you give me something 
               A
just to hold on to? 
		   C#m       
And if you'll stay, 
             D
I'll hold your hand 
		  Bm             
'Cause I'm truly, madly, 
                  E
crazy in love with you 

INTERLUDE
E-A 2x

E
Time has come 
	A            
For us to go our 
         E
separate ways 
E
God forbid 
	   A       
But my mind is 
             E
going crazy today 

B
I feel so cold 
	C#m
Feel so numb 
						
I'm having nightmares 
	  D
but I'm awake 
D
Help me lord 
			 E
Fight this loneliness 
			  A
Take this pain away
