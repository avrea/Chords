<PRE>INTRO
A-D

A7
Here she comes
Coming out of the water
Here she comes
Coming straight at me
Here she comes
Coming out of the water
Here she comes
Summer refugee

CHORUS
A7
I just wanna be on the beach
I just wanna be on the beach
I just wanna be on the beach
I just wanna be on the beach

A7
Here she comes 
Golden island senorita
Here she comes
Slowmo freeze the frame
Here she comes 
Golden island senorita
Here she comes 
Do you know her name?

REPEAT CHORUS

A7
I need to get away from the city
I need to get away from work
I need to get away from traffic
I need to get away, got to get away
