<PRE>INTRO
G-C

G
Why is that sad look in your eyes

Why are you crying
C
Tell me now, tell me now

Tell me why you're feeling this way
G
I hate to see you so down, oh baby
C            Em                
Is it your heart, ooh breakin' 
   Em7 
all to pieces
C           Em    Eb
Makin' you cry, makin' you feel blue

Is there anything that I can do?

CHORUS
			  G
Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby
		Em                   
And I'll do my best to make 
Em7
it better
		  C                      
Yes, I'll do my best to make the 
D
tears all go away
	G
Just tell me where it hurts, now tell me
		Em                
And I'll love you with a 
     Em7
love so tender
	   C
Oh, and if you let me stay
	   D         
I'll love all of 
         G
the hurt away

G
Where are all those tears comin' from

Why are they fallin'
   C
Did somebody, somebody

Somebody left your heart in the cold
G
You just need somebody to hold on, baby
C               Em      
Give me a chance to put 
             Em7
back all the pieces
C                  Em
Take your broken heart
 Eb
Make it just like new

There's so many things that I can do

REPEAT CHORUS
