<PRE>INTRO
G-F#m-G-F#m 2x

G
Standard pick-up lines
						 
That seems to wreck your 
DM7
bones
G                                 
Can this be a sequel of my dying 
DM7
hope?
Bm                           
Chasing down a never-ending 
       DM7
make-believe
Bm                            
But you're a perfect match of 
       G
consistency

CHORUS
D              
Will you come 
           F#m
back in a heartbeat?
G
Don't be confused 
			 Bm
Of what a great thing we could be
D                 
We'll take a walk 
            F#m
on the same street
G                             
Can you tell me how Boston is 
 Bm               D
like without me?

G
Your image is stamped
					
Beneath the insides 
	  DM7
of my heart
G                
Now you're gone, 
                        DM7
I don't know where to start
Bm
The evidence is showing
			
Like a stable 
		DM7
apprehension
Bm
But you're the only one
			
Who's apt for 
		  G
this affection

REPEAT CHORUS
