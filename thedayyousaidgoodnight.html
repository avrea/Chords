<PRE>INTRO
E-A

			 E
Take me as you are
		 A
Push me off the road
   C#m          B
The sadness I need 
				   A
This time to be with you
			  E
I'm freezing in the sun
			A
I'm burning in the rain
	C#m            B
The silence I'm screaming
	   A
Calling out your name

REFRAIN
  C#m           
And I do reside 
       B
in your heat
	   A         
Put out the fire 
          B
with me and find
   C#m                
Yeah, you lose the side 
 B
of your circles
	   A            
That's what I'll do 
              B
if we say goodbye

CHORUS
   E                 B
To be is all I gotta be
			 C#m
And all that I see
			   A
And all that I need is time
  E            
To me the life 
        B
you gave me
			   
The day you said 
C#m        A
goodnight

INTERLUDE
E-A

			E    
The calmness in your face
		 A
That I see through the night
  C#m           
The warmth of 
       B    
your light
			 A
Is pressing unto us
		  E
You didn't ask me why
	   A
I never would have known
C#m         
Oblivion is 
 B          A
falling down

REPEAT REFRAIN
REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
C#m          
If you could 
B
only know me
A                
Like your prayers 
     B
at night
C#m            
Then everything 
B                A
between you and me
			B
Will be alright

REPEAT CHORUS

E               B
She's already taken
			  C#m
She's already taken
				A
She's already taken me
E               B
She's already taken
			  C#m   
She's already taken 
 A-E-B
me
			
The day you 
		   C#m-A
said goodnight
