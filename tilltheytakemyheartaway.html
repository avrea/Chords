<PRE>INTRO
EM7-C#m-D 2x

EM7
I look into your eyes
  C#m      D
So far away
EM7
There's trouble on your mind
		C#m        D
You're losing faith
A                  B
Hey now, let me hold you
	   EM7 C#m
It will be okay
			  A
'Cause I will love you
		 B              E
Till they take my heart away

EM7
Remember when you told
	C#m         D
You said goodbye
EM7
You thought we've lost it all
   C#m     D
And so did I
A           B
Even if I lost you
		EM7    C#m
It will be the same
			  A
'Cause I will love you
		  B              A
Till they take my heart away

REFRAIN
	B      G#m       C#m
Believe, I'm here to stay
			 A 
'Cause I will love you
		 B              EM7
Till they take my heart away


	   EM7
Now we're stronger than before
   C#m            D
We made it through
EM7
I never felt more sure
 C#m          D
Because of you
A                     B
Hey now, are you listening
		EM7    C#m
Can you hear me say
			A
That I will love you
		  B             A
Till they take my heart away

REPEAT REFRAIN
