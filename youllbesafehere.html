<PRE>INTRO
Dm-G-F-Am-G-F

Dm
Nobody knows
		   Am      G
Just why we're here
Dm
Could it be fate
		   Am        G
Or random circumstance
Dm
At the right place
		  Am    
At the right time
   G         F
Two roads intertwine

Dm                 
And if the universe 
     Am  G
conspired
Dm
To mold our lives
		   Am       G
To make us fuel and fire
Dm                        
Then know wherever 
Am  
you will be
   G         F
So too shall I be

CHORUS

F           C
Close your eyes
		G
Dry your tears
	   Dm          
'Cause when nothing 
      Am
seems clear
	 G        C
You'll be safe here
		   G
From the sheer weight
		 Dm
Of your doubts and fears
	 Am
Weary heart
	   G        F pause
You'll be safe here

Dm
Remember how we laughed
		Am    G
Until we cried
Dm     
At the most stupid things
Am                 G
Like we were so high
Dm
But love was all 
			Am  
That we were on, 
G       F
we belong

Dm
And though the world 
			  Am      G
Would never understand
Dm
This unlikely union
  Am              G
And why it still stands
Dm                
Someday we will be 
Am      G
set free
			F
Pray and believe

	 C           G
When the light disappears
			   Dm    
And when this world's 
    Am
insincere
	  G       C
You'll be safe here
	  G                 
When nobody hears 
    Dm    
you scream
	  Am
I'll scream with you
	   G      C
You'll be safe here

ADLIB
C-G-Bb-Am-G#m-G-C

F          C
Save your eyes
		G
From your tears
	Dm            
When everything's 
 Am
unclear
	   G      C
You'll be safe here
			G
From the sheer weight
		 Dm
Of your doubts and fears
		 Am -G
Wounded heart

	   C       
When the light 
    G
disappears
			 Dm      
And when this world's 
   Am
insincere
	  G        C
You'll be safe here
	  G          
When nobody hears 
   Dm
you scream
	  Am
I'll scream with you
	  G       C
You'll be safe here

	  G
In my arms
		   Dm       
Through the long cold night
	  Am
Sleep tight
	  G       C
You'll be safe here
	 G          Dm           
When no one understands
		Am
I'll believe
	  G    C
You'll be safe
			 G
You'll be safe
			   
You'll be safe 
Bb   F
here, oh

C           G  
Put your heart 
          F
in my hands
	  G         C
You'll be safe here
