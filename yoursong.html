<PRE style="font-size:12px;">      B         F#
It took one look 
        G#m                
then forever laid out in 
E
front of me
        B          F#
one smile then i died
     G#m                E
only to be revived by you
         B              
there i was thought i 
 F#                     G#m
had everything figured out
     E                              
it goes to show just how much i 
B
know 
           E               F#
about the way life plays out

CHORUS 
     B        F#    E
I take one step away
         G#m   -    F#     
then i find myself coming 
  B       F#
back to you
    E            G#m -  F#   
my one and only one and only 
 B  F#  G#m  E
you

VERSE II
          B
now i know 
         F#                   G#m
that i know not a thing at all
  E                         
except the fact that i'am 
B
yours
          E         F#
and that you are mine

BRIDGE
 G#m        F#                     
oh if they told me that
				  E
this wouldn't be easy
    G#m     F#             E
and no i'm not one to complain
