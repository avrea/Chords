G
Tell me something
						  
When the rain falls on my 
Em
face
					 
How do you quickly 
C
replace it
Am                    
With a golden summer 
 G
smile
G
Tell me something
						   
When I'm feelin' tired and 
Em
afraid
				
How do you know 
			C
just what to say
  Am                
To make everything 
 G
alright

CHORUS
  C
I don't think that you even realize
   Am
The joy you make me feel 
				
When I'm inside 
G
your universe
	C
You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
 Am
I hate to break it to you
			 Em   
But it's just the 
                G
other way around
				   
You can thank your 
Am BREAK*
stars all you want
	Cm BREAK*
But I'll always
              G
 be the lucky one

G
Tell me something
				
When I'm 'bout 
		 Em
to lose control
					 
How do you patiently 
C       Am
hold my hand
				
And gently calm 
 G
me down
G
Tell me something
					
When you sing and 
	 Em
when you laugh
				
Why do I always 
	  C       Am
photograph my heart
				
Flyin' way above 
	   G
the clouds

REPEAT CHORUS
</PRE></div></div></div></div>
